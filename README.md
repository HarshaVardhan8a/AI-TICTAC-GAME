This is a terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human can play against an unbeatable AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to simulate all possible moves and always selects the optimal one.

### ðŸ”§ Features
- Two-player: Human (X) vs AI (O)
- Minimax algorithm with recursive evaluation
- AI never loses â€” always plays optimally
- Clean board printing using text

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Game Trees
- Decision Making (Minimax)
- Turn-based Logic

> This task helped me understand how AI makes decisions in games and how recursion can simulate all possible outcomes.
